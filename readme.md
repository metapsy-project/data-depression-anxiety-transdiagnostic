This MARD is part of the [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). The dataset contains study information and effect size data of transdiagnostic psychological interventions for depression and anxiety. The date of the last search update is provided [here](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-transdiagnostic-depression-anxiety/blob/main/metadata/last_search.txt). 

This dataset includes psychotherapy vs. control (`psy vs ctr`) comparisons. Effect sizes are provided for depression and anxiety outcomes at post-test.
It includes one type of effect size calculation per study, giving priority to means and standard deviations at post-test, followed by change scores, binary outcomes, and other statistics.
